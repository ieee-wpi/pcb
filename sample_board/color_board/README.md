### Color Board
This is a version of the sample board with full color silkscreen on both sides. JLCPCB offers this kind of silkscreen technology, but the Gerbers can only be made with their EDA software EasyEDA. The corresponding `.eprj` EasyEDA project file with the colorful silkscreen can only be opened with *EasyEDA Pro*.
