# Essentials of PCB Design Course
[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

Materials for WPI's project-oriented PCB design course. We've run this ever year at WPI through the IEEE Student Branch for several years now. The materials were created by [@dgorbunov](https://github.com/dgorbunov) and [@124274sashimi](https://github.com/124274sashimi), though future instructors of the class will differ. You can reach us at gr-pcb@wpi.edu.

> To access the lecture recordings, you must sign in with a WPI account. This is WPI's policy for Echo360 recordings.

## Getting Started
Not sure where to get started on your design? You'll need to download and install [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/download/). You'll also need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to program your board.

### Board
To get started on your own board design, navigate to [starter_board](https://github.com/IEEE-WPI/pcb/tree/main/starter_board) and read the instructions in the `README` file.

### Code
To get started uploading code to your board, navigate to [starter_code](https://github.com/IEEE-WPI/pcb/tree/main/starter_code) and read the instructions in the `README` file.
