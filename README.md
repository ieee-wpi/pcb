# Essentials of PCB Design Course

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

WPI's project-oriented PCB design course. The course is a four part evening lecture series where students learn to layout and route an embedded system. Students then receive their manufactured boards after two weeks and assemble them. The class was created by Daniel Gorbunov and Hubert Liu and has been run every year through the WPI IEEE Student Branch, which helps organize and fund the class. You can reach us at gr-pcb@wpi.edu if you have questions.

> To access the lecture recordings, you must sign in with a WPI account. This is WPI's policy for Echo360 recordings.

## Getting Started
Not sure where to get started on your design? You'll need to download and install [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/download/). You'll also need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to program your board.

### Board
To get started on your own board design, navigate to [starter_board](https://github.com/IEEE-WPI/pcb/tree/main/starter_board) and read the instructions in the `README` file.

### Code
To get started uploading code to your board, navigate to [starter_code](https://github.com/IEEE-WPI/pcb/tree/main/starter_code) and read the instructions in the `README` file.
