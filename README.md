# Essentials of PCB Design

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

Project-oriented PCB design course taught at WPI. The course is a evening lecture series where students learn to layout and route an embedded system. Students then receive their boards and assemble them. The class was created by [Daniel Gorbunov](https://github.com/dgorbunov) and [Hubert Liu](https://github.com/124274sashimi) in 2024 and has been run every year since through the [IEEE WPI Student Branch](https://ieee.wpi.edu), which helps fund the class. You can reach us at [gr-pcb@wpi.edu](mailto:gr-pcb@wpi.edu) if you have questions.

## Getting Started
Not sure where to get started on your design? You'll need to download and install [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/download/). You'll also need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to program your board.

### Board
To get started on your own board design, navigate to [starter_board](https://github.com/IEEE-WPI/pcb/tree/main/starter_board) and read the instructions in the `README` file.

### Code
To get started uploading code to your board, navigate to [starter_code](https://github.com/IEEE-WPI/pcb/tree/main/starter_code) and read the instructions in the `README` file.
