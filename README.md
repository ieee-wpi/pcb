## Essentials of PCB Design
Welcome! Here you can find all the materials for our PCB design class. We've run this at WPI in D24 and A24. This class is taught by [@dgorbunov](https://github.com/dgorbunov) and [@124274sashimi](https://github.com/124274sashimi). You can reach us at gr-pcb@wpi.edu.

### Lecture Recordings:
Recordings of lectures can be found [here](https://echo360.org/collection/4c2d5caf-a301-4c32-a2dd-bdd8c8c0b9d9/public). This unfortunately requires signing in with a WPI account. This is WPI's policy for Echo360 recordings.

## Getting Started
Not sure where to get started on your design? You'll need to download and install [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/download/). You'll also need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to program your board.

### Board
To get started on your own board design, navigate to [/starter_board](https://github.com/IEEE-WPI/pcb/tree/main/starter_board) and read the instructions in the `README` file.

### Code
To get started uploading code to your board, navigate to [/starter_code](https://github.com/IEEE-WPI/pcb/tree/main/starter_code) and read the instructions in the `README` file.
